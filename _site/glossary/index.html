<ul>
  <li>Advance copies: a few copies of the finished product sent ahead of the main consignment.</li>
  <li>Colours: the number or list of inks required. Most books are one colour inside (usually black) and four colours on the outer cover (cyan, magenta, yellow and black, or ‘CMYK’). Since each side of a page might have a different number of colours, colours are often expressed in pairs. For example ‘4 × 1’ means four colors on one side and one colour on the other. This is often pronounced ‘four back one’.</li>
  <li>Extent: sometimes refers to number of pages (page extent), and sometime to a list of all project components.</li>
  <li>Finished size: the height and width of the finished book.</li>
  <li>Flat size: the size of a sheet of printing paper before it is folded into book pages.</li>
  <li>Landscape format: the page is wider than it is high. Also called horizontal or album format. The opposite of portrait format.</li>
  <li>Pages: there are two pages for each leaf. While leaves are also called sheets, a sheet can also be a very large sheet of paper on which many pages will be printed before folding to book size. So it’s clearest to say, for example, that ‘one sheet folds to sixteen leaves or thirty-two pages’.</li>
  <li>PP: printed pages (the front is page one and and the back a second page), e.g. ‘32pp text’ means the book contains 32 printed pages, made up of 16 leaves, and excluding the cover.</li>
  <li>Portrait format: the height of the page is greater than its width. Also called upright or vertical format.</li>
</ul>
