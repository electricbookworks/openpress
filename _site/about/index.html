<h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1>

<p>When you print books, the more you print the cheaper it gets per copy. If you need copies of a book, Open Press lets you join together with others to print one big print run.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our <strong>members propose books</strong> they want to print together.</li>
  <li>We work out print costs to get a <strong>minimum print run and a price per copy</strong>. For instance, 1000 copies at R30 each. We also work out lower prices at higher print runs.</li>
  <li><strong>Members place orders</strong> for copies before the ordering deadline.</li>
  <li>If we have enough orders for our minimum print run by the deadline, <strong>we invoice members and go to print</strong>.</li>
  <li>If we get enough orders to hit higher print-run targets, we reduce the price for everyone. <strong>So members encourage others to order, too.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Everyone pays the same low price.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You must be a member to participate. <a href="/terms">Apply to join here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>There are many great open-licensed books, but nowhere to buy them in high-quality, printed editions at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Traditionally, publishers have to guess how many books to print, put the copies in a warehouse, and hope they sell. That is very risky. Worse, no one prints open-licensed books, because they canâ€™t control availability: anyone else might also do their own print run of the same book. And while print-on-demand helps with small quantities, the unit cost remains high. So, by pooling many orders into single print runs, we reduce unit costs and save everyone money. </p>

<p>Open Press is great for schools, colleges, non-profits and businesses who need to order multiple copies of books.</p>

<p>While focused on open-licensed books, Open Press also works with publishers to aggregate orders for closed content. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to discuss your project.</p>
