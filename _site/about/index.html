<h1 id="about-open-press">About Open Press</h1>

<p>There are many superb open-licensed books in the world, but nowhere to buy them in high-quality, printed editions at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Traditionally, publishers have to guess how many books to print, then put the copies in a warehouse, and hope they sell. That is very risky. And worse, no one’s going to print a run of open-licensed books, because they can’t control availability: anyone else might also do a print run of the same book.</p>

<p>Print-on-demand helps, but with POD we never get unit costs down, because there are no economies of scale.</p>

<blockquote class="shout">
  <p>At Open Press, we pool customers’ orders so that everyone’s books are printed in one big print run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By pooling small orders into big print runs, we reduce unit costs and save everyone money. Open Press is great for schools, colleges, churches, and businesses who need to order multiple copies of books.</p>
