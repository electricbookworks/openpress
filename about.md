# About Open Press

There are many great open-licensed books, but nowhere to buy them in high-quality, printed editions at reasonable prices.

Traditionally, publishers have to guess how many books to print, put the copies in a warehouse, and hope they sell. That is very risky. Worse, no one prints open-licensed books, because they can't control availability: anyone else might also do their own print run of the same book. And while print-on-demand helps with small quantities, the unit cost remains high.

> At Open Press, we pool orders so that everyone's books are printed in one big print run.

By pooling many orders into single print runs, we reduce unit costs and save everyone money. Open Press is great for schools, colleges, non-profits and businesses who need to order multiple copies of books.

## Behind the scenes

The original Open Press concept was developed by Mark Horner and the teams at [Siyavula](http://siyavula.com) and the [Shuttleworth Foundation](http://shuttleworthfoundation.org). It is now an [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com) project led by [Arthur Attwell](http://arthurattwell.com).
